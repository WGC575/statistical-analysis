KS Test: Results
Kolmogorov-Smirnov Comparison of Two Data Sets

The results of a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test performed at 23:12 on 10-MAR-2019

The maximum difference between the cumulative distributions, D, is: 0.1765 with a corresponding P of: 0.930

Data Set 1:

17 data points were entered

Mean = 6.550

95% confidence interval for actual Mean: 1.838 thru 11.26

Standard Deviation = 9.16

High = 29.0 Low = 0.00

Third Quartile = 6.58 First Quartile = 1.08

Median = 3.000

Average Absolute Deviation from Median = 5.37

John Tukey defined data points as outliers if they are 1.5*IQR above the third quartile or below the first quartile. Following Tukey, the following data points are outliers: 29.0 26.2 19.7

KS says it's unlikely this data is normally distributed: P= 0.00 where the normal distribution has mean= 9.583 and sdev= 10.78

Data Set 2:

17 data points were entered

Mean = 6.730

95% confidence interval for actual Mean: 1.873 thru 11.59

Standard Deviation = 9.45

High = 37.1 Low = 0.00

Third Quartile = 7.67 First Quartile = 0.765

Median = 4.290

Average Absolute Deviation from Median = 5.50

John Tukey defined data points as outliers if they are 1.5*IQR above the third quartile or below the first quartile. Following Tukey, the following data points are outliers: 37.1

KS says it's unlikely this data is normally distributed: P= 0.01 where the normal distribution has mean= 10.46 and sdev= 12.25
